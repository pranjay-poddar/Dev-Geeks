# Spacecraft Orbital Mechanics Simulator

This C++ program simulates the motion of a spacecraft influenced by the gravitational force of a celestial body (planet). It calculates the spacecraft's trajectory over a specified period using numerical integration.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
3. Run the compiled executable.

## Program Description

The program performs the following tasks:

1. Takes user input for the celestial body's mass, initial position, and initial velocity.
2. Takes user input for the spacecraft's mass, initial position, and initial velocity.
3. Defines the celestial body (planet) and spacecraft using the input values.
4. Simulates the spacecraft's motion over a specified time period using numerical integration.
5. Outputs the spacecraft's final position.
