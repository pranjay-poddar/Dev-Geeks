 # Forest Climate Change Impact Assessment System

This program assesses the impact of climate change on the health of trees in a forest. It allows users to input data for individual trees, including their species and initial health score. The program then simulates the impact of climate change on tree health based on temperature and precipitation changes provided by the user.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.

2. Download the `main.cpp` file, which contains the C++ code for the Forest Climate Change Impact Assessment System.

3. Compile the code using the C++ compiler:

# Instructions

- The program will prompt you to enter the temperature change (in degrees Celsius) and precipitation change (in millimeters) due to climate change.

- Next, you will be asked to enter the number of trees in the forest.

- For each tree, you should provide the following information:
        1. Species: Enter the species of the tree.
        2. Initial health score: Enter the initial health score of the tree, ranging from 0.0 to 100.0.

- After providing information for all the trees, the program will display the initial forest health report.

- The program will then simulate the impact of climate change on tree health and display the updated forest health report.

- You can choose to display the updated forest health report with color-coded health levels (healthy, moderate, or vulnerable) for better visualization.
