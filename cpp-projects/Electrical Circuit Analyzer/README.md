## Electrical Circuit Analyzer

The Electrical Circuit Analyzer is a C++ program that allows you to analyze electrical circuits consisting of resistors, capacitors, and inductors. It calculates the total resistance, capacitance, and inductance of the circuit, as well as the total impedance at a specified frequency.

# How to Use

- Run the program.
- Enter the number of components in your circuit when prompted.
- For each component, enter its type and value as follows:
  
1. Enter 'R' for a resistor and its resistance value in ohms.
2. Enter 'C' for a capacitor and its capacitance value in farads.
3. Enter 'L' for an inductor and its inductance value in henrys.

- The program will display the total resistance, capacitance, and inductance of the circuit.
- Enter the frequency for AC impedance calculation in hertz (Hz).
- The program will display the total impedance of the circuit at the specified frequency.
