 # Engineering Calculator Command-Line Tool

This C++ program provides a simple command-line calculator with various engineering functionalities. It allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, unit conversions, and vector operations.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/).
- Trigonometric functions: sin, cos, tan (input angle in degrees).
- Unit conversions: degrees to radians (d2r), radians to degrees (r2d).
- Vector operations: vector addition (vadd), vector subtraction (vsub).

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
