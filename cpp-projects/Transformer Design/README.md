# Transformer Design Calculation

The Transformer Design Calculation program is a C++ application that allows you to design and analyze the parameters of a transformer based on user input. It calculates the turns ratio, core area, wire size, and efficiency of the transformer.

## How to Use

- Run the program.

- Enter the following parameters of the transformer when prompted:
        1. Primary voltage (V): The voltage on the primary side of the transformer.
        2. Secondary voltage (V): The voltage on the secondary side of the transformer.
        3. Frequency (Hz): The frequency of the alternating current (AC) power supply.
        4. Power rating (kVA): The power rating of the transformer in kilovolt-amperes.
        5. Magnetic flux density (Tesla): The desired magnetic flux density in the transformer's core.

- The program will validate the input to ensure that all values are positive.

- The program will then calculate the following transformer parameters:
        1. Turns Ratio: The turns ratio between the primary and secondary windings of the transformer.
        2. Core Area: The area of the transformer's core in square centimeters.
        3. Primary Wire Size: The size of the primary wire in square millimeters.
        4. Secondary Wire Size: The size of the secondary wire in square millimeters.
        5. Efficiency: The efficiency of the transformer in percentage.

- The program will display the calculated transformer parameters.
