 <h1>Knapsack Algorithm</h1>
 
  

 <p align="justify">
Put the weights and values of N objects in a knapsack of capacity W to attain the highest total value in the knapsack. We can break things in Fractional Knapsack to maximise the total value of the knapsack.

 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p align="justify">
 Place the weights and values of N objects in a W-capacity knapsack to achieve the highest overall value in the knapsack. To increase the total worth of the knapsack, we can break things down into fractional knapsacks.
