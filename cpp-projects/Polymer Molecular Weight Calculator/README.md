# Polymer Molecular Weight Calculator

The Polymer Molecular Weight Calculator is a C++ program that calculates the molecular weight of a polymer chain with a given sequence of monomer units. It also provides the option to add or modify custom monomer weights and calculate the weight-average molecular weight of the polymer.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `main.cpp` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `main.cpp`.
3. Compile the C++ code using your preferred C++ compiler. For example:
4. Run the executable file:
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the polymer sequence and the number of repeating units.
6. The program will calculate the molecular weight of the polymer chain and display the result.

## Custom Monomer Weights

The program initializes default monomer weights for commonly used monomer units, such as Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). However, users have the option to add or modify custom monomer weights for their specific polymer compositions. When prompted, users can enter the monomer unit (e.g., 'C', 'H', 'O') and its corresponding molecular weight (in g/mol). The program will then remember the custom monomer weight for future calculations.
