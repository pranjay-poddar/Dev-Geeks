# Astrophysical Data Analysis

This C++ program calculates various statistical measures for a set of astronomical data points. It provides functions to calculate the average, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values of the data. Additionally, it offers the ability to remove outliers using sigma-clipping.

## Features

- Calculate the average of a vector of doubles.
- Calculate the standard deviation of a vector of doubles.
- Find the minimum and maximum values in a vector of doubles.
- Remove outliers from a vector of doubles using sigma-clipping.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Change into the project directory:

3. Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):

4. Run the executable:

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the number of astronomical data points and the data itself.

6. The program will display the calculated average, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values of the data. It will also show the data after sigma-clipping, which removes outliers.
