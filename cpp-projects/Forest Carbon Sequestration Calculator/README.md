# Forest Carbon Sequestration Calculator

This C++ program calculates the carbon sequestration of a forest based on the number of trees, their health scores, age, and diameter. It also allows users to simulate the impact of climate change on tree health and recalculate carbon sequestration.

## Features

1. Add individual trees to the forest with their species, health score, age, and diameter.
 
2. Calculate the total carbon sequestration of the forest based on tree data and species-specific carbon sequestration rates.
  
3. Display a forest health report showing species, health scores, age, and diameter of each tree.
  
4. Simulate the impact of climate change on tree health scores (temperature change and precipitation change) and update the forest health.
   
5. Recalculate the total carbon sequestration of the forest after simulating climate change impact.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.

2. Download the `main.cpp` file, which contains the C++ code for the Forest Carbon Sequestration Calculator.

3. Compile and Run the program.
