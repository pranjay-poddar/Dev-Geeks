# Forest Health Monitoring System

The Forest Health Monitoring System is a C++ application for assessing and monitoring the health of trees in a forest. It allows users to add tree data, simulate the impact of diseases and stress factors, calculate the health scores of individual trees, and identify vulnerable trees based on their health scores.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.

2. Download the `main.cpp` file, which contains the C++ code for the Forest Health Monitoring System.

3. Compile and Run the program.

## Features

- Add Tree Data: Allows users to add tree data, including species, height, diameter, and initial health score, to the forest.

- Display Forest Health: Displays a report containing the health status of all trees in the forest, including their species, height, diameter, and health score.

- Update Tree Health Score: Enables users to simulate the impact of diseases or stress factors on the health scores of individual trees. Users can enter the species of the tree and the health change (between -10 and 10).

- Identify Vulnerable Trees: Allows users to identify vulnerable trees in the forest based on a user-defined health score threshold. The system displays all trees with health scores below the specified threshold.

# Usage

- When you run the program, you will be welcomed to the Forest Health Monitoring System and provided with an introduction to its features.

- Enter the number of trees in the forest when prompted.

- Input tree data for each tree, including species, height, diameter, and initial health score.

- The program will display the initial forest health report.

- Simulate the impact of diseases or stress factors on the health scores of individual trees by providing the species and the health change.

- The updated forest health report will be displayed after the health simulation.

- Identify vulnerable trees by specifying a health score threshold. The system will display all trees with health scores below the specified threshold.

- To exit the application, follow the on-screen instructions.
