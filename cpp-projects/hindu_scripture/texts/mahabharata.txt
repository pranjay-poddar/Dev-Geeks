Mahabharata Excerpt:
"The sage Vyasa, who is the son of Satyavati by Parasara, and is a portion of Vasudeva, who is the foremost of all persons conversant with the Vedas, and who is the embodiment of the Vedas himself, and who is the author of twenty-four thousand verses, came to the son of Gavalgani for dwelling with him.

Vyasa, being possessed of great ascetic merit, began to reside in the sacred retreat of the son of Gavalgani, and taking his post in observance of a vow, Vyasa began to compose the Mahabharata. And, O king, the composition thus commenced in the retreat of Gavalgani in former days by Krishna-Dwaipayana of austere penances, was finished in this region, O monarch, after many long years.

Thus, O best of monarchs, was the vast body of the Mahabharata composed by the high-souled Krishna-Dwaipayana, the son of Parasara, himself a portion of Vasudeva and the first of all intelligent persons. The sage had Nara for his disciple, and he lived in the retreat of Gavalgani on the Himavat."
