# Special Relativity Visualizer

This C++ program provides a visualizer for special relativity calculations. It allows you to explore the effects of time dilation, length contraction, and relativistic velocity addition based on relative velocities and rest lengths of objects.

## Features

- Calculate time dilation factor (Î³) based on the relative velocity.
- Calculate length contraction based on the relative velocity and rest length of an object.
- Perform relativistic velocity addition for two velocities.
- Visualize the effects of special relativity using user-provided data.

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler:
