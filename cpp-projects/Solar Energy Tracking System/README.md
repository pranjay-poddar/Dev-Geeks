# Solar Position Calculator

The Solar Position Calculator is a C++ program that calculates various solar parameters based on a given geographic location (latitude and longitude) and date. It provides information about the position of the sun in the sky at a specific time, including solar altitude angle, solar azimuth angle, solar power generation, sunrise time, and sunset time.
