## Electrical Safety Calculator

The Electrical Safety Calculator is a C++ program that allows you to perform safety calculations and checks for electrical circuits and loads. It helps you determine the maximum safe current and power for a given voltage and power rating, create and store safety scenarios, and check if a specific load is within the safe operating range based on the stored scenarios.

# How to Use
