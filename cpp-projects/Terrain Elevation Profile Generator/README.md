# Terrain Elevation Profile Generator

This C++ program simulates a terrain elevation profile generator. It allows you to input data points with distance and elevation information, generate an elevation profile, interpolate elevation at a specific distance, and modify existing data points.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
3. Run the compiled executable.

## Program Description

The program performs the following tasks:

1. Adds initial data points with distance and elevation information.
2. Generates and displays the elevation profile, including distance, elevation, and slope.
3. Interpolates and displays the elevation at a specified distance.
4. Modifies an existing data point's elevation and updates the elevation profile.
5. Regenerates and displays the updated elevation profile.
