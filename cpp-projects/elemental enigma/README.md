<h1>Elemental Enigma</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
Elemental Enigma is an educational puzzle game that challenges players to solve mysteries and unlock the secrets of the elements. Players embark on an adventure where they must uncover hidden knowledge about the periodic table and the properties of various chemical elements. Through a series of engaging puzzles and challenges, they explore the fascinating world of chemistry and deepen their understanding of elemental concepts.
<h2>Rules</h2>
The "Elemental Enigma" project allows players to test their knowledge of chemical elements. It randomly selects an element from a predefined list and provides hints to the player. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct name of the element.

During each attempt, the program displays a hint to the player and prompts them to enter their guess. The player's input is compared with the correct element's name, considering case sensitivity. If the player guesses correctly, their score is incremented based on the number of attempts made.

After the game ends, the program displays whether the player's guess was correct, the final score, and the properties of the selected element.
