# Ore Grade Analysis

The Ore Grade Analysis is a C++ program that performs analysis on the grades of ore samples to provide valuable insights into the quality and characteristics of an ore deposit. The program calculates various parameters, including the average grade, highest grade, lowest grade, grade variability, ore reserve, and statistical measures (mean, variance, and standard deviation) based on user-provided inputs.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `main.cpp` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `main.cpp`.
3. Compile the C++ code using your preferred C++ compiler. For example:
4. Run the executable file:
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the number of ore samples, the ore grades, volume of the ore deposit, and the cutoff grade.
6. The program will display various calculated parameters, ore classification, and statistical analysis of the ore grades.

## Calculation Details

The Ore Grade Analysis program performs the following calculations based on user inputs:

- Average Grade
- Highest Grade
- Lowest Grade
- Grade Variability
- Ore Reserve
