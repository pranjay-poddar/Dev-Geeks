# Blast Vibration Analysis

The Blast Vibration Analysis is a C++ program that calculates various effects of a blast at a given distance from the explosion. The program estimates the Peak Particle Velocity (PPV), air overpressure (noise), scaled distance, and ground vibration frequency based on user-provided inputs such as the distance from the blast, explosive charge weight, and distance exponent.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `main.cpp` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `main.cpp`.
3. Compile the C++ code using your preferred C++ compiler. For example:
4. Run the executable file:
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the distance from the blast, explosive charge weight, and distance exponent.
6. The program will display the calculated blast effects, including PPV, scaled distance, air overpressure, and ground vibration frequency.

## Calculation Details

The Blast Vibration Analysis program performs the following calculations based on user inputs:

- Peak Particle Velocity (PPV)
- Scaled Distance
- Air Overpressure
- Ground Vibration Frequency
