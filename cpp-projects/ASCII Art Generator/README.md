# ASCII Art Generator

The ASCII Art Generator is a C++ program that converts an image file into ASCII art. The program takes an image file in PPM format (P6) as input and produces ASCII art representation of the image.

# Features

- Convert an image to ASCII art using a set of ASCII characters representing different shades.

- Resize the image while preserving the aspect ratio.

- Supports PPM image format (P6).

# Getting Started

- Compile the program using a C++ compiler.

- Run the compiled executable.

- Follow the on-screen instructions to input the image path and desired width for the ASCII art.

# Usage

1. Enter the path to the image file you want to convert to ASCII art.

2. The program will read the image in PPM format and process it.

3. Enter the desired width for the ASCII art (the program will adjust the height accordingly).

4. The program will generate and display the ASCII art representation of the image.
