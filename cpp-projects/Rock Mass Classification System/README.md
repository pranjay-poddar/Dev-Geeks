# Rock Mass Classification System (Rock Mass Rating - RMR)

This C++ program calculates the Rock Mass Rating (RMR) based on user-input rock mass parameters. RMR is a widely used classification system to assess the engineering properties and stability of rock masses. The program determines the rock mass class and provides engineering recommendations based on the RMR value.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `main.cpp` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `main.cpp`.
3. Compile the C++ code using your preferred C++ compiler. For example:
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the rock mass parameters.

## Classification Details and Engineering Recommendations

Based on the calculated RMR value, the program classifies the rock mass into one of the following categories:

- Class I - Very Good
- Class II - Good
- Class III - Fair
- Class IV - Poor
- Class V - Very Poor

The program provides engineering recommendations corresponding to each rock mass class, indicating its suitability for various excavation activities and support requirements.
