 # Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This program allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher with a specified shift value.

## Usage

1. Compile the program:

2. Run the program:

3. Enter the shift value for encryption. The shift value determines how many positions each character will be shifted in the alphabet.

4. Enter the message to encrypt or decrypt. The program will automatically detect if the input contains alphabetic characters and perform the corresponding operation.

5. Choose the mode:
- Enter `1` for Encryption: The program will encrypt the message using the provided shift value.
- Enter `2` for Decryption: The program will decrypt the encrypted message using the reverse shift value.

6. The encrypted or decrypted message will be displayed as the output.

7. The program will ask if you want to continue. Enter `y` or `n` to encrypt or decrypt another message, or any other character to exit the program.

## Features

- Encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher.
- Customizable shift value: You can set the shift value between 1 and 25 for encryption and decryption.
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Preserves non-alphabetic characters: Any non-alphabetic characters in the input message will remain unchanged in the output.
