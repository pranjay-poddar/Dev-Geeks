In this cpp project "Contact managment" almost everything was included.Only the apperance is not clear .I worked on that part of this project .

I try to make output clear and consise , using '*'and line space wherever needed.

Ater completion of one function in project and after printing of output.

As this project is contact managment which store contact of different poples.Earlier phone number ,name is enough as a contact detail but in today's world email is one of the most important as a contact detail.

I try to add "email" in this project as one more contact detail but getting some error and still I am working on it .
