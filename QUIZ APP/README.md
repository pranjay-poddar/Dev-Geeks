# Quizing : Quiz App
## Inspiration ðŸŽ‡
I have experienced, that most of the Quiz apps we use in our school/colleges don't immediately tell whether the chosen option is correct or not, neither they are responsive or have good UI. 

## What it does âœ¨
Quiz app that is responsive as well as tells if the chosen option is correct and levels up your knowledge.

## How we built it ðŸ› 
It is built using HTML,CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript.


## What's next for Quizing: Quiz App ðŸŽ™
I will add a meme feature after every selected answer, as well as an option to choose an answer with audio-only using ALAN.
