## Get dataset
- Get the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)

## Get you API_KEY [here](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) and add it to app.py in `API_KEY = "..."`

## Run this project

### Get required files
- Install Python (Dont forget to tick Add to Path while installing Python)
- Clone this project
- Open project directory in terminal and run following commands :
```sh
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Generate pickle file
- Run [mrs_main](mrs_main.ipynb)
- Two files will be generated `movie_dict.pkl` and `similarity.pkl`

### Run App
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in you default browser, If not, open your browser and goto `http://localhost:8501`
