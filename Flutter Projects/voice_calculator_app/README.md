##Voice Calculator

Voice Calculator is a Flutter application that allows users to perform calculations using their voice input. It provides a user interface with buttons for manual input as well as a voice recognition feature for hands-free operation.Here is an easy to use voice calculator to calculate numbers using multi operator and numbers! -all numeric number using (zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten) -all operator +addition-plus,add +subtraction- minus, subtract +multiplication-multiply, multiply by, into, times +divide- divide, divide by -equal operator +speaking equal at last and using press equal button.
