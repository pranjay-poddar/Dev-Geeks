# Folded List

This project showcases a creative CSS effect called "Folded List," which gives the appearance of a list with folded edges, creating an interesting visual effect.

## How it Works

1. The HTML file contains a simple structure with a `<section>` element containing an unordered list `<ul>`.

2. Each list item `<li>` contains a `<span>` element with text content.

3. The CSS file provides styling for the body, text, and the folded list effect.

4. The background of the page is styled using a radial gradient, giving it a vibrant appearance.

5. The list items are styled with a perspective effect using CSS `perspective`, creating the folded appearance.

6. The `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements are used to create the folded edges, and the `nth-child` selector is used to apply different styles to even and odd list items.

7. The text in the list items is given a slight rotation effect using the `transform` property.
