# CSS Caterpillar Loader

This project showcases a simple CSS loader animation named "Caterpillar Loader." It consists of a series of circles that move up and down to create a caterpillar-like animation.

## How it Works

1. The HTML file contains a basic structure with a header and a container to hold the loader animation.

2. The CSS file provides styling for the body, header, and the animation elements. The loader animation is created using keyframes and animations.

3. The loader animation is created using a series of circles (`div` elements) with the same class name "circle." Each circle has a single character inside it (one letter from the word "Loading") and moves up and down using CSS animations.

4. The circles are positioned using absolute positioning and delays in the animation to create the desired caterpillar-like movement effect.
