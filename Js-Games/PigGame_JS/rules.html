	<h1 align="center"> GAME RULES </h1>

	<p class="p1">- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds</p>
	<p class="p1"> - In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score </p>
	<p class="p1">- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn </p>
	<p class="p1">- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.</p>
	<p class="p1">- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game

<p class="p1">- But wait.. There is a twist in the game, if any of the player rolls two 6 in a row, that player will lose his entire global score and all his score will be 0, also a 1 last and amazing twist is -- suppose any of the player is far away from the other player(winning), and the other player rolls 6 , and if he holds and passes the dice to the player who is winning , then keep in mind that the other player already rolled a 6 and passed it, now...if the player who is winning rolls a 6 on his 1st attempt, that player will lose his entire global score..and the turn will be passed as well. Interesting. right. </p>
