        <h2>How to Tetris</h2>

        <h3>A Brief History</h3>

        <br>

        <p class="headings">Gameplay</p>

        <p>Tetris is composed of a grid of play in which pieces of different geometric forms, called

            "tetriminos", fall from the top of the grid.While falling, the player can move the pieces

            laterally and rotate them until they touch the bottom of the grid or land on a piece that had been placed

            before it. The objective of the game is to use the pieces to create as many horizontal lines of

            blocks as possible. When a line is completed, it disappears, and the blocks placed above fall one rank.

            Completing lines grants points, and accumulating a certain number of points moves the player up a level,

            which increases the number of points granted per completed line.</p>

        <br>

        <p class="headings">Tetriminos</p>

        <p>The pieces on which the game of Tetris is based around are called "tetriminos". Pajitnov's original version

            for the Electronika 60 computer used green brackets to represent the blocks that make up tetriminos.

            Versions of Tetris on the original Game Boy/Game Boy Color and on most dedicated handheld games use

            monochrome or grayscale graphics, but most popular versions use a separate color for each distinct shape.

            Prior to The Tetris Company's standardization in the early 2000s, those colors varied widely from

            implementation to implementation.</p>

        <br>

        <p class="headings">Scoring</p>

        <p>The scoring formula for the majority of Tetris products is built on the idea that more difficult line clears

            should be awarded more points. For example, a single line clear in Tetris Zone is worth 100 points, clearing

            four lines at once (known as a Tetris) is worth 800, while each subsequent back-to-back Tetris is worth

            1,200. In conjunction, players can be awarded combos that exist in certain games which reward multiple

            line clears in quick succession. The exact conditions for triggering combos, and the amount of importance

            assigned to them, vary from game to game.



            Nearly all Tetris games allow the player to press a button to increase the speed of the current piece's

            descent or cause the piece to drop and lock into place immediately, known as a "soft drop" and a "hard

            drop", respectively. While performing a soft drop, the player can also stop the piece's increased speed by

            releasing the button before the piece settles into place. Some games only allow either soft drop or hard

            drop; others have separate buttons for both. Many games award a number of points based on the height that

            the piece fell before locking, so using the hard drop generally awards more points.</p>

        <p class="headings">How to Play</p>

        <p>You start a new game by pressing the <strong>Start Game</strong> button. Tetriminos will begin to fall from the top of the

            grid and begin to pile up at the bottom. You, the player, must rotate the Tetriminos to best fit together

            and complete lines across the width of the grid. Each successful clear will result in the line being removed

            from the grid and you awarded 15 points. For every 5 lines cleared you will gain a level. The game continues

            till the Tetriminos reach the top of the grid, at which point the game is over.
