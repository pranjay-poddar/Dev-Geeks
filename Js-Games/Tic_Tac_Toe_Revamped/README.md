## **Description**

- Built as part of The Odin Project, to play the game [click here](https://0xabdulkhalid.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)
- The purpose of the project was to use the Module pattern and the Factory Pattern to build and design objects to incorporate game logic
- The Game offers a Player vs Player game mode

## **Outcome**

* Game logic is built with **Module pattern** and **Factory Functions**
* Efficiently used **data** attributes to manipulate dom elements
* Well optimized **UI** and **UX**
* Site was built responsive via **Mobile first workflow**
* **Cross tested** on Firefox and Chromium based browsers

<br>

## **What I learned**

* Usage of **data-** attribute which provides the ability to embed custom data on all elements which will be used to further manipulate game logic
* Usage of **module pattern** to improve the maintainability and reusability of the code by creating public and private access levels
* Learned the Logic behind the Tic tac toe game
* A lot of minor things
