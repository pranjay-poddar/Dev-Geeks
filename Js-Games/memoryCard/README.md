# **Memory Card** 

## **Description ðŸ“ƒ** 
- The game starts by displaying a grid of faced-down cards.
- The player can click on a card to reveal its face.
- When the player clicks on a card, the card flips over, revealing its image or symbol.
- If it's the first card the player has clicked, its value is stored for comparison.
- If it's the second card the player has clicked, its value is also stored for comparison.
- After the second card is revealed, the game checks if the two cards match.
- If the two cards match, they stay face-up, and the player earns a point.
- If the two cards do not match, they are flipped back face-down.
- The player's score is updated accordingly.
- The player continues to select pairs of cards until all cards are matched and face-up.
- The game ends and displays a message with the player's final score and a prompt to play again.
