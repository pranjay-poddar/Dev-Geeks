* The game is called TRIVIA Memory, a memory test game. Images will be displayed in a flash and the player needs to answer a question - in a flash - relating to the image.

* These are timed questions that incorporates setInterval(), clearInterval() and setTimeout() in Javascript.

* As the page loads, an intro music will autoplay and instructions will be displayed. A start button is also present.

* Once the button is pressed, the left screen clears and images will appear on the right side for five seconds. The image refers to the hint for the following question to help player to guess the answer.

* After five seconds, the image disappears and a question will be displayed on the left side with multiple choices for an answer. A clock starts ticking for 10 seconds with a matching countdown sound effect and is visually displayed.

* If the player selects the correct answer, a screen will congratulate them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, the next question is automaticall displayed without user input.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

* If the player runs out of time, the player will be informed that time's up and display the correct answer.  The next question will automatically show.

* If the player chooses the wrong answer, the player will be informed they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. The same scenario as before, the next question/slide will automatically display.
