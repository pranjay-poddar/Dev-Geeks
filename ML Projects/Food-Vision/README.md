# Food-Vision
This is project that is done as a part of PyTorch for deep learning by ZTM. This is a more advanced version of the Food-Vision-Mini. In this I used all of the data that is all types of food available on the dataset is used. I used `EfficientNetV2` as my model which was taken from the pytorch models through `transfer learning`.

I deployed the project on to `Hugging FaceðŸ¤—` using `Gradio`.
