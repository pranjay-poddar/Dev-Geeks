## CNN , ResNET50 Algorithm

DL-CNN stands for Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network. It is a type of artificial neural network specifically designed for image and visual data processing tasks. DL-CNNs have revolutionized computer vision tasks by achieving state-of-the-art results in various applications, including image classification, object detection, segmentation, and image generation.

Transfer learning:- Transfer learning is a popular technique in deep learning that involves using pre-trained models as a starting point for new tasks or datasets. One of the widely used pre-trained models is ResNet50, which is a variant of the Residual Network (ResNet) architecture with 50 layers.

ResNet50:- is a powerful convolutional neural network that has been trained on a massive dataset (e.g., ImageNet) to solve an image classification task with over 1,000 classes. It has learned to extract meaningful and hierarchical features from images, making it a strong feature extractor.
