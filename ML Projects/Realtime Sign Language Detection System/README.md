<br>

**Technologies**:
1) Tensorflow
2) Python
3) OpenCV
4) LSTM Deep Learning Model

**Key Features**:

1) Developed a model using Tensorflow and Python, which can extract real-time video sequences, using OpenCV for Face and Sign Matching. <br>
2) This model can ease the method of communication, for those people who are deaf, blind and dumb. <br>
3) The extracted video sequences were used to train the model using LSTM Deep Learning Model. <br>
