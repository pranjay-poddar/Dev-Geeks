As we know , there is a huge population of people who have special needs and their way of communication is through sign language 
Therefore ,In this project - we have created an Indian Sign Language Detection Model using OpenCV and Deep Learning modules Tensorflow & Keras 

Dataset Link :- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vaishnaviasonawane/indian-sign-language-dataset


Libraries Used :-
1.Numpy
2.OpenCV
3.OS
4.Tensorflow & Keras 

Tasks Performed :-

 1.Dataset Preprocessing :-
 a. acquiring the dataset
 b. resizing & grayscaling the images 
 c.Storing the Preprocessed Dataset
   
2. Splitting the preprocessed dataset into Training and Testing Data

3. Creation of a Deep Leaning (CNN) Model for sign language detection :-
 a. loading the train_generator and the test_generator with appropriate parameters
 b. creation of the model
 c.Optimizing the model and training it on train_generator
 d.Compiling and saving the Model


 4.Loading the model for prediction.
