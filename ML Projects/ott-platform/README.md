### Recommendation System:
We will be implementing Collaborative Filtering Recommender System. 

Collaborative Filtering is the process of filtering for information or patterns using techniques involving collaboration among multiple agents, viewpoints, data sources, etc.

There are two classes of Collaborative Filtering:

User-based, which measures the similarity between target users and other users.

Item-based, which measures the similarity between the items that target users rate or interact with and other items.
