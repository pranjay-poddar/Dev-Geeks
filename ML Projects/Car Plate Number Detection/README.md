# Car Plate Number Detection 

### 1) EasyOCR, Imutils, OpenCV:
- **EasyOCR**: EasyOCR is a popular Python library that provides an easy-to-use interface for optical character recognition (OCR). It allows you to extract text from images, making it suitable for car plate detection. EasyOCR supports multiple languages and provides accurate results.
- **Imutils**: Imutils is a convenience library that provides a set of utility functions to simplify common image processing tasks. It provides functions for resizing, rotating, and translating images, among others. Imutils can help manipulate images before applying further processing steps.
- **OpenCV**: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a powerful open-source library for computer vision and image processing tasks. It provides a wide range of functions and algorithms to perform various operations on images and videos, such as reading and writing images, applying filters, detecting objects, and more. OpenCV is commonly used in car plate detection projects due to its versatility and performance.

### 2) Preprocessing:
In the preprocessing step, we perform the necessary operations to prepare the image for further analysis. One common technique is to convert the image from the RGB color space to grayscale. By doing this, we reduce the image to a single channel, saving memory and processing time. Additionally, the grayscale representation can enhance certain image features relevant to car plate detection.

### 3) Apply filters and edges detection:
After converting the image to grayscale, we can apply various filters to enhance specific features and reduce noise. Filters like Gaussian blur, median blur, or bilateral filter can help smoothen the image and improve edge detection. Edge detection algorithms, such as Canny edge detection, can then be applied to identify the boundaries of objects in the image. By detecting edges, we can focus on the important contours and eliminate irrelevant details, which ultimately speeds up the analysis process.

### 4) Find contours and apply masks:
Once we have applied filters and performed edge detection, we can find contours in the image. Contours are the boundaries of connected components in an image. By finding contours, we can isolate the potential car plate regions. Sorting the contours in descending order based on their area allows us to prioritize the larger and more prominent shapes, which are more likely to correspond to car plates.

### 5) Using EasyOCR for text recognition and printing it on the image:
After isolating the car plate region using contours and polygons, we can apply EasyOCR to perform text recognition. EasyOCR will analyze the extracted region and extract the text information present on the car plate. Once the text is recognized, we can overlay it on the image, enabling us to visualize the detected car plate and the corresponding text information. This step allows for easy identification and verification of the car plate details.
