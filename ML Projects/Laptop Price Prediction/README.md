# Laptop Price Prediction 

### The following steps have been taken: 

Step 1: Data Cleaning - looking for null/ duplicate values, removing unnecessary columns, etc.

Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis - Comparing the realtion of price with each of the other aspects like RAM, weight, Company, Type etc and making 
correlation matrix. 

Step 3: Feature Engineering - Extracting multiple columns from a single column, by taking only the necessary information. 

Step 4: Training and testing model - Training and testing the data by splitting the majority section of data in training and the rest for testing. 

Step 5: Calculating the MAE & R2Score of various models that have been used 


### The list of the models used - 

1) Linear regression
2) Ridge Regression
3) Lasso Regression
4) KNN 
5) Decision Tree
6) Random Forest 
7) Gradient Boost 
8) XgBoost 

### Conclusion 

Random Forest gives the best accuracy and the least MAE score. 

R2 score 0.8873402378382488

MAE 0.15860130110457718
