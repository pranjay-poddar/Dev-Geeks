# Posture detection using PoseNet | Machine Learning Project in Javascript
posenet-demo-ml5js

This project aims to detect the body posture using (posenet demo built using ml5.js), we'll be using javascript with machine learning there are some library ml5.js, TensorFlow.js,etc

## p5.js and ml5.js Algorithm

-> p5.js is a JavaScript library that simplifies the process of creating interactive graphics and animations in the browser. It provides an easy-to-use API for drawing shapes, creating animations, handling user input, and working with multimedia elements like images and sound.

p5.js is inspired by the Processing language and framework, which was primarily designed for visual arts and creative coding

-> ml5.js is a JavaScript library that provides an easy-to-use interface for machine learning in the browser. It simplifies the integration of pre-trained machine learning models and allows developers to use them for various tasks, such as image recognition, sound classification, natural language processing, and more.

The library is built on top of TensorFlow.js, which is a powerful machine learning library for JavaScript, enabling efficient computation on GPUs or CPUs in the browser.
