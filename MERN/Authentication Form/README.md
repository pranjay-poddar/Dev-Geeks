### Chakra UI is used to build the layout.

-> I've used industry level folder structure.
-> You can use this project as a template and can build other projects on the top of this.
-> I've used "redux-toolkit" for state management as well as "redux-persist" to store the state into local storage.

# To use the code:-

1. You need Node Js to be installed in your PC.
2. Make your own MongoDB cluster by visiting their official website and copy paste the connection url to a new folder i.e .env in the server folder as MONGO_URL="link".
3. In that folder only, set a new key-value pair as JWT_SECRET="anything you want" and then PORT=3009.
4. Now in the terminal, change directory to client as well as server and type npm install.
5. Now in client directory, type "npm run dev" and in server directory, type "node index.js" or "nodemon index.js".
6. And you are good to go :)
