# Take Online Notes

When we make notes on paper to remember something, we all run into the problem of getting them lost or misplaced. Finding a specific note among all the notes is the most challenging thing.

The digital version of notebooks, Take Online Notes website offer more benefits than paper ever could. Your notes are always accessible on your device at any time.

In this website you can easily create note by adding some text. The note you create will be saved until you decide to delete it. Your notes will still be saved if you close the tab or the browser because I used localStorage in this website. You can also change the theme of the website using toggle button. Additionally, there is a search option that allows you to find notes by simply typing any word that appears in the note.

# Getting Started with Create React App

First Clone the repository then go to the directory. In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
