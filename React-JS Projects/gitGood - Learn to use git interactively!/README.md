<p>This project idea came into my mind right when I started learning web developement and started playing around with git and GitHub. It consists of an <strong>in browser terminal</strong> with a psuedo file system that is staged and pushed through the CLI to the <strong>mock GitHub window</strong> (I tried my best with the GitHub ui recreation lol). There's also a Windows folder window to showcase how the folder structure would look on a GUI system. The instructions tab on the left tells the user what to do and which commands to run.<br/><br/>This was a project I initially planned on doing with vanilla js, but as I dove deeper into the abyss that is the react ecosystem, I figured this would be much more fun done in react. It taught me a whole lot about <strong>state management</strong> and why larger projects would need something like redux. It's a <strong>desktop only</strong> website made to not function on mobile intentionally. You can still run a few commands on the phone version though.</p>
