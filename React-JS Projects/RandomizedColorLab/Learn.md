# Learning Through This Document:


üëâThrough this readme, you will learn about two of the hooks provided by React, called _**useState**_ and _**useEffect**_. **useState()** sometimes called "_**State Hook**_" lets us add native state to React function components. **useEffect()** sometimes called "_**Effect Hook**_" is used to direct the component to perform an action as it renders.

**<h3>What is a Hook?</h3>** A Hook is a special function that lets you ‚Äúhook into‚Äù React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.

**<h3>When would I use a Hook?</h3>** If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component.

**<h3>What is "useState()" in React?</h3>** **useState()** is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components . To use the <ins>useState</ins> Hook, we first need to <ins>import</ins> it at the top of our component.
_Like this:_

_Now, let's take an example of useState():_

**<h3>What does calling "useState()" do?</h3>** It declares a ‚Äústate variable‚Äù. Here, our variable is _**isWin**_ but we could call it anything else, like _**dolphin**_. This is a way to ‚Äúpreserve‚Äù some values between the function calls ‚Äî **useState** is a new way to use the exact same capabilities that **this.state** provides in a class. Normally, variables ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù when the function exits but state variables are preserved by React.

_Some other examples:_

-   _**Line 6:**_ Represents an array useState to hold 6 different color hexcodes.
-   _**Line 7:**_ Represents a numerical useState and here its initial value is set to zero.
-   _**Line 8:**_ Represents a boolean useState and its initial value can be set to null/true/false.

**<h3>What does "useState()" return?</h3>** It returns a pair of values: the current state and a function that updates it. This is why we write _const [num, setnum] = useState()_.

_For example:_

-   _**Line 1:**_ We import the **useState** Hook from React. It lets us keep local state in a function component.
-   _**Line 4:**_ Inside the _**Example**_ component, we declare a new state variable by calling the _**useState**_ Hook. It returns a pair of values, to which we give names. We‚Äôre calling our variable num because it holds the number of button clicks. We initialize it to zero by passing _**0**_ as the only _useState_ argument. The second returned item is itself a function. It lets us update the num so we‚Äôll name it _**setnum**_.
-   _**Line 9:**_ When the user clicks, we call setnum with a new value. React will then re-render the _**Example**_ component, passing the new _**num**_ value to it.

**<h3>What is "useEffect()" in React?</h3>** **useEffect()** is a Hook that tells React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you pass inside the useEffect() and call it later after performing the DOM updates. To use the <ins>useEffect</ins> Hook, we first need to <ins>import</ins> it at the top of our component.
_Like this:_

_Now, let's take an example of useEffect():_

**<h3>What is "useCallback()" in React?</h3>** **useCallback()** is a Hook that returns a <i>memoized</i> function. This essentially means that, React creates a "cached" version of the function. To use the <ins>useCallback</ins> Hook, we first need to <ins>import</ins> it at the top of our component.
_Like this:_

`import { useCallback } from 'react';`

_Now, let's take an example of useCallback():_

`useCallback(() => {}, []);`

**<h3>What does calling "useCallback()" do?</h3>** The <i>memoized</i> (or "cached") function changes only if any of the values passed to it in the <i>dependency array</i> changes. This in turn, saves time and resources, because React doesn't need to redefine the same function every time a component re-renders.

<pre><code>const resetRandomised = useCallback(() => {
    const newArray = new Array(numberOfColors);
    for (let idx = 0; idx < hexcode.length; idx++) {
      newArray[idx] = `#${Math.floor(Math.random() * 16777000).toString(16)}`;
    }
    setHexcode(newArray);
    setnum(Math.floor(Math.random() * 6));
    setIsWin(null);
  }, [hexcode.length]);</code></pre>

-   `const resetRandomised = useCallback(() => { ...` - This is the function that is being memoized.
-   `... }, [hexcode.length]);` - This is the dependency array. The function will only change if the length of the hexcode array changes.

**<h3>Prettier?</h3>**
[Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html) is an open source, opinionated, code formatter which can be used to format all of your files so that they all follow the same coding style.

This helps when working on large project with multiple contributors to ensure that everyone follows the same same formatting standard
