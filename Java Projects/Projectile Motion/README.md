Projectile Motion Simulation

This is a Java program that simulates the motion of a projectile launched at an angle and initial velocity. 
The program uses the equations of motion to calculate the projectile's position at regular time intervals and displays the results on the command line.
It also provides additional features like calculating the maximum height, range, and time of flight for the projectile.

Features

Launch Angle and Initial Velocity
Time Interval and Maximum Simulation Time
Air Resistance Option
Position Display
Maximum Height and Range Calculation
Time of Flight

How to Use

Compile the Java program:
Run the compiled program:
Follow the on-screen instructions to provide the launch angle, initial velocity, time interval, maximum simulation time, and choose whether to consider air resistance.

The program will display the position of the projectile at each time step until it hits the ground or reaches the maximum simulation time. It will also show additional information, such as the maximum height, range, and time of flight.
