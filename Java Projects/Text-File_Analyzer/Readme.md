# Java Text File Analyzer

This Java program reads a text file and provides a basic analysis by counting the number of lines, words, and characters in the file.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.

2. Save the Java code as `TextFileAnalyzer.java` in your desired directory.

3. Compile the Java code using a Java compiler. You can use the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   javac TextFileAnalyzer.java
After compiling successfully, run the Java program using the following command:
java TextFileAnalyzer

The program will prompt you to enter the path of the text file you want to analyze.

After entering the file path, the program will display the following information:

Number of lines in the file
Number of words in the file
Number of characters in the file

## Example

Suppose you have a text file named `sample.txt` with the following content:

This is a sample text file.
It contains multiple lines of text.
Let's see how the analyzer handles it.

Running the script and providing the path to `sample.txt` would output:
Number of lines: 3
Number of words: 17
Number of characters: 96

## Note

This script provides a basic analysis for simple text files. It may not handle complex file formats or special cases.
