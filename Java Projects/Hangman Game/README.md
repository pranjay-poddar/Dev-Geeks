#How to Play
At the start of the game, you will be presented with an underscored word representing the number of letters in the word to be guessed.
You can guess letters one at a time by entering them at the prompt.
If the guessed letter is part of the word, the corresponding underscores will be replaced with the correct letter.
If the guessed letter is not part of the word, the number of attempts will be reduced by one.
You cannot guess the same letter multiple times, and guessing incorrect letters will decrease your attempts.
The game ends when you either successfully guess the entire word or run out of attempts.
