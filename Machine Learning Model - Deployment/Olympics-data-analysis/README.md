# olympics-data-analysis-web-app
A Streamlit web application for the analysis of olympics dataset

This project aims , building an Olympics Data Analysis Web Application using Streamlit. For development, I will be using Python and Pandas. For plotting, I will be using Seaborn and Plotly libraries.Variables include Name, Sex, Age, Height, Weight of the athlete, his team name, sport, event and the year, season, city of the olympics he/she took part in. In addition, the data captures the medal won (if any) by the athlete. 
## Dataset

Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results


## Algorithm

preprocessing-helper: Library container generic helper functionality for preprocessing in machine learning projects.

Helper functions simplify complex analysis tasks and make the code modular and reusable. In the Olympic data analysis project, you can create helper functions to perform common tasks and computations efficiently.

Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for Olympic data analysis can be an interesting approach, especially when dealing with classification tasks or finding similar countries/athletes based on their Olympic performance. In this context, we can use KNN to identify countries or athletes with similar performance profiles and make predictions based on their neighbors. 

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the project:

streamlit
