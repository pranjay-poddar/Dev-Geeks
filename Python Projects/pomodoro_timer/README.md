Pomodoro Timer: Boost Your Focus and Productivity
The Pomodoro Timer is a Python application built using the Tkinter library. It is designed to help users implement the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that improves focus and productivity by breaking work into intervals and incorporating short breaks.

Features
Customizable Work and Break Durations: Users can set the duration of work sessions and breaks according to their preferences. By default, the work session is set to 25 minutes, and the break duration is set to 5 minutes, aligning with the traditional Pomodoro Technique.

Visual and Audible Cues: The timer provides visual and audible cues to keep users informed about the current phase. It changes color when transitioning between work and break sessions, and an alarm sound is played when each session ends.

Session Tracking: The timer keeps track of the number of completed work sessions, allowing users to visualize their progress and measure productivity.

Start and Reset: Users can easily start the timer with a single click and reset it to the initial state to begin a new Pomodoro cycle.
