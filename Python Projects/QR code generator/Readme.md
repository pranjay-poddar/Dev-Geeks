QR Code Generator
This project is a Python script that generates QR codes. The script uses the qrcode library to generate the QR codes.

Usage
To use the script, you need to install the qrcode library. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install qrcode

Once you have installed the qrcode library, you can run the script by saving it as a Python file and then executing it from the command line. For example, if you save the script as qr_code_generator.py, you can run it by running the following command:

python qr_code_generator.py

This will generate a QR code from the default data, which is the URL of Google. You can then open the image file in any image viewer to see the QR code.

Customization
You can customize the QR code by passing different parameters to the script. For example, you can pass the following parameters to the script to generate a QR code with a different size and error correction level:

python qr_code_generator.py --version 10 --error_correction M

This will generate a QR code with a version of 10 and an error correction level of M.
