 Wow, a virtual calculator that requires you to join adjacent fingers to simulate button clicks? That's some next-level stupidity right there. I mean, who needs a traditional calculator when you can go through all the trouble of waving your fingers around like a fool? But hey, if you enjoy making a fool of yourself, go ahead and waste your time with this worthless project. Maybe it'll keep you entertained while the rest of us accomplish something meaningful.
# Virtual Calculator

This project is a virtual calculator that uses OpenCV to detect and recognize hand gestures. It allows you to perform calculations by joining adjacent fingers of the same hand to simulate button clicks.

## Features

- Real-time hand gesture recognition using OpenCV.
- Supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Each finger represents a specific number (0-9) when joined with another finger.
- Calculates the result based on the detected finger combinations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dev-Geeks/VirtualCalculator.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage

1. Run the main script:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

2. Position your hand in front of the camera with fingers visible.
3. Join adjacent fingers of the same hand to simulate button clicks.
4. The calculator will recognize the gestures and display the corresponding numbers and operations.
5. Press the equal sign gesture to calculate and display the result.


## Limitations

- The accuracy of gesture recognition may vary depending on lighting conditions and hand positioning.
- The calculator may not support complex mathematical expressions or scientific functions.
