# DISCORD QUOTE GENERATOR

This code basically builds a discord bot that generates quotes according to your mood. Like if you're feeling now just write *!inspirational* or *!happiness* to find a quote that lifts your mood.


## Requirements 

Install discord, requests and json using command prompt.

Generate a API Key from [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/) and replace it with `[API KEY]` and replace `[TOKEN]` with your own token.


Then open the 'bot.py' file and run the code.

Once it shows you'll have the discord bot on your server and it'd give you quotes as per your requirements:)

HAPPY CODING</>
