## Details
user is expected to input a range, i.e., the lower and upper limits of a range  
the program lists all the perfect numbers in that range.  
Perfect number is a number (positive integer) which is equal to the sum of all its proper divisors.  

Examples:    

lower limit: 1  
upper limit: 30  
perfect numbers in the said range:  6 28  
[6 has proper divisors 1, 2, 3; where 1+2+3=6]  
[28 has proper divisors 1, 2, 4, 7, 14; where 1+2+4+7+14=28]  

lower limit: 45  
upper limit: 100  
perfect numbers in the said range:  None
