## Details
The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle consisting of three rods and a number of disks of various diameters, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape. The puzzle is to transfer this set of discs to another rod using a rod in the middle as support.  

A larger disc should never be on top of a smaller one.  
Only one disc can be moved at a time.  
Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.  

User is expected to input the number of discs.  
The program lists the sequence of minimum number of moves to be carried out to solve the puzzle.

Example:    

number of minimum moves: 7  
Procedure with minimum number of moves:  
Disc 1: L -> R  
Disc 2: L -> C  
Disc 1: R -> C  
Disc 3: L -> R  
Disc 1: C -> L  
Disc 2: C -> R  
Disc 1: L -> R
