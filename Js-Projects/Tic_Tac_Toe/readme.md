# Tic Tac Toe Project

This project is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns and aims to detect when a player has won or when it's a draw.

## Getting Started

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository or copy the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into separate files on your local machine.
2. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser.
3. The Tic Tac Toe game will be displayed on the web page.

## Game Instructions

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Two players take turns marking empty spaces on the grid with their respective symbols ('X' or 'O').
3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page, including the game board and buttons.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the visual styles for the game elements.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that implements the game logic and functionality.

## Dependencies

This project does not require any external dependencies or libraries.
