## User Experience:
1. Click on "Show a Meme" button on right side of the page to display a meme on the left side of page under 'Memes' heading. Similarly, clicking on other buttons will allow you to see a joke, a quote and its author, and a riddle.
2. After clicking a button, if the user had previously clicked a button, then the previous output will be deleted and only the current output will be shown.
3. On clicking the "Riddle me" button, a new button wil appear below it saying "Reveal riddle answer". As the name suggests, the answer to the given riffle question will be displayed.
4. On clicking the "Reveal riddle answer" multiple times, an alert will be displayed saying that the answer has already been revealed. 
5. On clicking some other option apart from "riddle me" and "Reveal riddle answer", the "Reveal ridddle answer" button wil disappear.
