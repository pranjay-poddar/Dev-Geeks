# Image Upload using Drag and Drop

This is a simple web page that allows users to upload images using drag and drop or by clicking the "Upload" button. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How it Works

1. Users can either drag and drop an image file onto the designated drop area or click the "Upload" button to browse and select an image file from their device.

2. The selected image file is checked to ensure it is a valid image file with extensions `jpeg`, `jpg`, or `png`.

3. If the selected file is a valid image, it is displayed on the page inside the drop area.

4. If the selected file is not a valid image, an alert is displayed informing the user that it is not an image file.

## Valid Image Extensions

The project currently supports the following valid image extensions:

- `jpeg`
- `jpg`
- `png`
