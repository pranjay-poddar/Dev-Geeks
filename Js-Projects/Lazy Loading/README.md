## Lazy Loading Animation

This is a javascript-css based animation that blurs the background unitil fully loaded, revealing it bit by bit during the loading process of the page.

## Usage
- The user executes the project into a browser.
- The page starts loading, initially blur.
- As the loading progresses, the blurryness gets reduced.
- The page is fully rendered at 100% loading.
