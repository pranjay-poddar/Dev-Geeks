- 2048 is a puzzle game where players slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid, merging tiles with the same value to reach 2048. Strategic moves are needed to combine tiles and prevent grid filling. Achieve the highest tile value or end the game when no moves are possible.

## **How to play? üïπÔ∏è**
<!-- add the steps how to play games -->
- 
Open the game on your device or visit the game's website.
You will see a 4x4 grid with two randomly placed tiles of value 2 or 4.
Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) or swipe gestures (on touch devices) to move the tiles in the desired direction.
As you make a move, all tiles on the grid will slide as far as possible in that direction.
When two tiles with the same value collide due to a move, they will merge into a single tile with their values added together.
After each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 will appear at a random empty position on the grid.
Continue making moves, aiming to merge tiles and reach higher values.
Strategize and plan your moves carefully to avoid filling up the grid and creating opportunities for merging.
The game ends when you reach the 2048 tile (or a higher value, depending on the variant) or when there are no more possible moves.
