# Image based Password Strength 
It is a simple UI feature essentially useful for people exploring web development for the first time. <br>
The project also has a challenge to weigh symbols like $ and # differently to decrease blur. The changes need to be made in script.js. Go for it.

## **Functionality**

- As you increase the length of the password the strength or clarity of background dicreases as blur index decreases.
