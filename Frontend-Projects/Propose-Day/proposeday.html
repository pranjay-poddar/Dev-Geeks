  <h3 id="center">PROPOSE DAY ❤️</h3>

  <p id="p1">Propose Day is all about expressing your true feelings to the one who really matters to you. Expressing
    your love for someone is not an easy task, but it is crucial to let your heart out and reveal your hidden feelings.
    On this day, take the plunge and gather the courage to confess to your crush, friends or beloved. Whether you want
    to pop up the big question or just want to reignite the fire, propose day is just the right day for you...
  </p>
  <p id="p2">
    Propose day is an important day not just for the singles but also for the couples. Even if you are already in a
    happy and a committed relationship, you can still send romantic messages to reignite the old spark by proposing to
    your partner once again. Some propose their partner for marriage while some ask for a committed relationship. If you
    still haven’t told your special someone about how you feel, then what better than Propose Day to spill the beans! Go
    an extra mile and put in extra efforts to show how much they mean to you. Take inspiration from these lovely
    messages and wishes that will sweep your love off his/her feet.
