- DuckHunt is a fast-paced shooting game where players aim to shoot down flying ducks with precise timing and accuracy. Test your reflexes and compete for the highest score in this classic hunting experience.



## **Functionalities üéÆ** 
The Retro Dungeon Maze Puzzle game features a set of game logic that governs the mechanics and rules of the gameplay. Here's a high-level overview of the game logic:

- Maze Generation: The game generates random mazes with walls, corridors, and various obstacles using algorithms like depth-first search or recursive backtracking.

- Player Movement: The player can move in four directions (up, down, left, and right) using touch controls. The game ensures that the player stays within the boundaries of the maze and cannot move through walls.

- Objectives: The primary objective of the game is to find the exit of each maze and progress to the next level. To achieve this, the player may need to collect keys or other items scattered throughout the maze.

- Collisions and Interactions: The game checks for collisions between the player and the obstacle.
