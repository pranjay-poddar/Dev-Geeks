## **How to play? 🕹️**

<!-- add the steps how to play games -->

- The player can select two adjacent gems to swap their positions. The selected gems are checked for a valid move, meaning the swap would result in a match. If it's a valid move, the gems are swapped, and the grid is checked for matches.
  The grid is scanned for matches after every valid move. Matches can be horizontal or vertical. If a match is found, the matched gems are removed from the grid, and new gems fall to fill the empty spaces.
  Points are awarded to the player based on the number of gems cleared in each match. Bonus points can be given for creating special combinations or making consecutive matches.
