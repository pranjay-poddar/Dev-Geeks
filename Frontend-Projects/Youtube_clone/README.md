# YouTube Clone 

This is a YouTube clone web application built using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and the YouTube Data API. It allows users to search for videos, play them, and view video details.

## Prerequisites

To run the YouTube clone, you need the following:

- Web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)
- YouTube Data API key (You can obtain it from the Google Developer Console)

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.

2. Obtain a YouTube Data API key from the Google Developer Console. If you don't have one, follow these steps:
    - Go to the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
    - Create a new project (or select an existing one).
    - Enable the YouTube Data API for your project.
    - Create credentials and generate an API key.

3. Open the project directory and locate the `app.js` file.

4. Open the `app.js` file in a text editor.

5. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your YouTube Data API key obtained in step 2.

6. Save the `app.js` file.

7. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

8. You should now see the YouTube clone web application.

## Usage

The YouTube clone allows you to perform the following actions:

- **Search for videos**: Enter your search query in the search bar and press Enter. The application will display a list of videos based on your search query.

- **Play a video**: Click on a video thumbnail to play it. The video will be displayed in the video player section.

- **View video details**: Below the video player, you can see the video title, channel name, description, and other relevant details.
