                A cover letter is a one-page document that you submit as part of your job application (alongside your CV or Resume).

            <li>Translation Services</li>
            <p>
                Translation services are professional services that translate written and spoken content from one language into another. 
                Expert translation services typically offer translations into hundreds of languages and for a range of industries.

            <li>Proofreading and Editing</li>
            <p>
                By definition, proofreading is a surface-level check. It is the final check performed on a document. A proofreader will look for misspellings, incorrect/missed punctuation, inconsistencies (textual and numerical), etc. 
                Editing, on the other hand, corrects issues at the core of writing like sentence construction and language clarity.
