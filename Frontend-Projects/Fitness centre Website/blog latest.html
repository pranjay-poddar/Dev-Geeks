        <p class="blog-post-meta">7 JULY 2022</p>


        <div>This is my first blog and in this blog, I’ll share a few tips which will profit you prior to joining a gym,
            and
            furthermore, I’ll share my experience on my first day at the gym.
            I always wanted to join a gym because it gives you access to a wider variety of exercise equipment, so it’s
            easier
            for you to get a complete, full-body workout.
            Moreover, you’re less likely to get bored. Gyms are also social in nature because you get to work out with
            other
            people — they are places to see and be seen.
        </div>
        <div>
            I still remember my first day at the gym and I really can’t express how excited I was.

            You remember when our school used to take us on one-day trips and how much excited we used to be to wake up
            go
            get ready, that was my excitement level.

            I woke up at sharp 5:00 am, brushed my teeth, had a glass of warm water, and had some dry fruits.

            I reached the gym and I was amazed by its ambiance. I quickly wore my gym shoes and met my trainer. The
            trainer
            gave me a detailed explanation of the different gym exercises, diet and also asked me a few questions.

            My gym started with some warmup exercises, and later, I did a cardio workout as it was my cardio day.

            Finally, I ended up my first gym workout with some stretching exercises which are a must guys please
            remember,
            never skip stretching, or probably you may wind up with torment in your body.

            The trainer was so kind and guided me very well throughout my first day.

            After my first workout, I was extremely hungry and I had a slice of brown bread with peanut butter on top,
            two
            boiled eggs, one banana, and a glass of milk.

            That was my awesome experience on my first day at the gym.

        <div>I was attending to a patient in the Emergency Department of my hospital. The patient was a young, obese
            female. Seeing the team struggling even to secure the cannula, I realised the people who suffer the most
            when you gain an excessive amount of weight is your healthcare team. That’s when things changed and I
            decided to shed all the extra kilos and get back in shape.
            The journey from 90 kilos to 63 kilos wasn’t an easy one, but it was definitely worth it.

            My breakfast: A cup of black tea, 5 almonds soaked overnight in water and one fruit.My lunch: Grilled fish
            or omelette with loads of green vegetables.My dinner: Grilled chicken, unflavored yoghurt and a bowl of
            green salad.Pre-workout meal: A cup of black coffeePost-workout meal: My post-workout meal was my dinnerI
            indulge in:
            Rice and roasted chicken Low-calorie recipes I swear by: Definitely a bowl of green salad.All these food
            were Suggested by To class Trainer

            Weight loss is simple mathematics. Calculate your BMI/BMR and adjust your calorie intake and workout
            sessions accordingly.How do I stay motivated?
            I always make it a point to click pictures every time I reach a milestone.
            My phone wallpaper is of the time when I used to weigh 90 kilos. Seeing how far I have come definitely keeps
            me motivated.How do you ensure you don’t lose focus?
            Knowing that I should treat myself with love and respect doesn’t allow me to let my body, mind and soul go
            through any sort of stress--be it unhealthy food or unwanted worries.

            Fat to Fit.</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">23 APRIL 2022</p>
        <div>I had been overweight for a couple of years and put on around 20 kilos after finishing college in 2017,
            all due to poor lifestyle and stress. The pattern continued in 2019, and I was diagnosed with PCOS and
            Hashimotos
            Thyroiditis (autoimmune condition). These conditions are faily common now. But it doesn't mean it has to be
            normal.
            When I was handed over my diagnosis- along with medicines- it really did shook me. This was truly the
            turning point for me.
            So, I decided there on to bring in changes- no matter at what cost. I began to exercise twice a day and eat
            healthy,
            but still struggled for a while with losing weight. This made me dig deep in to my own condition and
            with the help of Ayurveda literature and functional medicine literature – I found some of the answers.
            And finally with the right knowledge and application I managed to drop 20 kilos in six months.
            Although it took me some time to figure out the puzzle by addressing root cause issues - it worked ! I was
            finally there !
        </div>
        <div>
            I primarily followed a gluten-free and dairy-free diet. Going gluten-free may not be required for everyone
            but because I had a leaky gut as well I did this.
            But going dairy-free is something I highly recommend for everyone.

            - I began my day with a green vegetable smoothie topped with chia seeds. This was to control insulin levels
            in the body, as PCOS is a precursor for diabetes.

            - My lunch would be a bajra bhakri or brown rice with a bowl of vegetables or salad + daal.

            - Evening snack is ideally the most important – I’d have a bowl of sprouts chaat, makhana bhel or fruits
            topped with mixed nuts and seeds.

            - I would eat my dinner by 7:30 pm and it would be grilled fish or chicken with a bowl of soup or salad. On
            days I was hungrier I’d eat my meal with some rice.
