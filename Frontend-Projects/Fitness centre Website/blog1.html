    <h1 class="r1">First Day at Gym</h1>
    <div class="r2">This is my first blog and in this blog, I’ll share a few tips which will profit you prior to joining a gym, and
    furthermore, I’ll share my experience on my first day at the gym.
    I always wanted to join a gym because it gives you access to a wider variety of exercise equipment, so it’s easier
    for you to get a complete, full-body workout.
    Moreover, you’re less likely to get bored. Gyms are also social in nature because you get to work out with other
    people — they are places to see and be seen.

        I still remember my first day at the gym and I really can’t express how excited I was.

        You remember when our school used to take us on one-day trips and how much excited we used to be to wake up go
        get ready, that was my excitement level.

        I woke up at sharp 5:00 am, brushed my teeth, had a glass of warm water, and had some dry fruits.

        I reached the gym and I was amazed by its ambiance. I quickly wore my gym shoes and met my trainer. The trainer
        gave me a detailed explanation of the different gym exercises, diet and also asked me a few questions.

        My gym started with some warmup exercises, and later, I did a cardio workout as it was my cardio day.

        Finally, I ended up my first gym workout with some stretching exercises which are a must guys please remember,
        never skip stretching, or probably you may wind up with torment in your body.

        The trainer was so kind and guided me very well throughout my first day.

        After my first workout, I was extremely hungry and I had a slice of brown bread with peanut butter on top, two
        boiled eggs, one banana, and a glass of milk.

        That was my awesome experience on my first day at the gym.
