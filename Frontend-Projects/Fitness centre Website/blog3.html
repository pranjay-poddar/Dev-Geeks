    <h1 class="r1">I lost 20 kgs with PCOS by going dairy and gluten-free just because of trainer of Fat to Fit.</h1>
    <div class="r2">I had been overweight for a couple of years and put on around 20 kilos after finishing college in 2017, 
        all due to poor lifestyle and stress. The pattern continued in 2019, and I was diagnosed with PCOS and Hashimotos 
        Thyroiditis (autoimmune condition). These conditions are faily common now. But it doesn't mean it has to be normal.
         When I was handed over my diagnosis- along with medicines- it really did shook me. This was truly the turning point for me. 
         So, I decided there on to bring in changes- no matter at what cost. I began to exercise twice a day and eat healthy, 
         but still struggled for a while with losing weight. This made me dig deep in to my own condition and 
         with the help of Ayurveda literature and functional medicine literature – I found some of the answers. 
         And finally with the right knowledge and application I managed to drop 20 kilos in six months.
         Although it took me some time to figure out the puzzle by addressing root cause issues - it worked ! I was finally there !

    <div class="r2">
I primarily followed a gluten-free and dairy-free diet. Going gluten-free may not be required for everyone but because I had a leaky gut as well I did this. 
But going dairy-free is something I highly recommend for everyone.

- I began my day with a green vegetable smoothie topped with chia seeds. This was to control insulin levels in the body, as PCOS is a precursor for diabetes.

- My lunch would be a bajra bhakri or brown rice with a bowl of vegetables or salad + daal.

- Evening snack is ideally the most important – I’d have a bowl of sprouts chaat, makhana bhel or fruits topped with mixed nuts and seeds.

- I would eat my dinner by 7:30 pm and it would be grilled fish or chicken with a bowl of soup or salad. On days I was hungrier I’d eat my meal with some rice.
