    <h1 class="r1">I lost 23 kilos in just 5 months just by getting proper guidance from Fat to Fit Website<h1>
    <div class="r2">I was attending to a patient in the Emergency Department of my hospital. The patient was a young, obese female. Seeing the team struggling even to secure the cannula, I realised the people who suffer the most when you gain an excessive amount of weight is your healthcare team. That’s when things changed and I decided to shed all the extra kilos and get back in shape. 
        The journey from 90 kilos to 63 kilos wasn’t an easy one, but it was definitely worth it.

        My breakfast: A cup of black tea, 5 almonds soaked overnight in water and one fruit.My lunch: Grilled fish or omelette with loads of green vegetables.My dinner: Grilled chicken, unflavored yoghurt and a bowl of green salad.Pre-workout meal: A cup of black coffeePost-workout meal: My post-workout meal was my dinnerI indulge in: 
        Rice and roasted chicken Low-calorie recipes I swear by: Definitely a bowl of green salad.All these food were Suggested by To class Trainer

        Weight loss is simple mathematics. Calculate your BMI/BMR and adjust your calorie intake and workout sessions accordingly.How do I stay motivated? 
        I always make it a point to click pictures every time I reach a milestone.
         My phone wallpaper is of the time when I used to weigh 90 kilos. Seeing how far I have come definitely keeps me motivated.How do you ensure you don’t lose focus? 
         Knowing that I should treat myself with love and respect doesn’t allow me to let my body, mind and soul go through any sort of stress--be it unhealthy food or unwanted worries.
