        >For this New Sounds, hear music that comes from here, but looks over
        there. It could be Arab music, Indonesian music, Moroccan music, Balkan
        music, or Ethiopian music, but it’s all music by Americans recreating
        sounds from elsewhere. Listen to music by the Anbessa Orchestra, who are
        Israeli musicians based in Brooklyn (and now L.A.) who are fans of the
        “golden age” of Ethiopian music.
