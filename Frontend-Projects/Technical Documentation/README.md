Any document that outlines the features of a certain product is considered technical documentation. In this project, I will use HTML and CSS to produce technical documentation for Comparison Sorting algorithms. The website contains a navigation section that makes it easier to access its various components

 <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
 <p align="justify"> Technical documentation is any document that explains the features of the respective product. In this project, we are going to create technical documentation of Sorting Algorithms by using HTML and CSS. The webpage has a menu section that helps to navigate to different sections of the webpage.

<h2 id="scope">Approach</h2>
 <p align="justify">
The entire website will be split into two areas. The Documentation Menu menu on the left features a navigation bar with all the topics listed inside it. It includes anchor tags with connections to all of the section IDs. The concept behind this is that when a user clicks on one of the topics on the left area, the content on the right will load with the appropriate topic data.
