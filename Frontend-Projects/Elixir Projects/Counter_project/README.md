# Elixir

Elixir is a dynamic, functional language for building scalable and maintainable applications.It is a concurrent, high-level general-purpose programming language that runs on the BEAM virtual machine, which is also used to implement the Erlang programming language. Elixir builds on top of Erlang andshares the same abstractions for building distributed, fault-tolerant applications. Elixir also provides tooling and an extensible design.
