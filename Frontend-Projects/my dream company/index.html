      <p id="hello">WORK WITH A DREAM ADVISOR TO PLAN FOR YOUR FUTURE</p>
      <p>Any time is a good time to establish a financial plan. Every plan needs a baseline, so next you should determine your net worth. Make a list of all your assets (bank and investment accounts, real estate, valuable personal property) and another one of all your debts (credit cards, mortgages, student loans). Your assets minus your liabilities equals your net worth.

        “Don’t be discouraged if your liabilities outweigh your assets,” Rob says. “That’s not uncommon when you’re just starting out—especially if you have a mortgage and student loans.”</p>
