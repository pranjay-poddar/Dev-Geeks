# Junkier Foodies / Restaurant Page

- A single page web application, build during partial completion of Odin Project
- Goal is to build the entire site with JavaScript which is seperated as modules.
- The modules are further imported and bundled with `Webpack`
- Building this project helps me to understand the basic concepts of `Webpack` easily
- This project uses `npm` package manager, so make sure to install it.
